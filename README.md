# BAB_BOT
BAB-BOT is an interactive chatbot designed to answer common interview questions and provide basic information. It allows users to simulate a mock interview and receive responses based on their input.

## Features
- Answering common interview questions: BAB-BOT is equipped with a collection of predefined responses to handle typical interview questions.
- Mock interview simulation: Users can engage in a mock interview with BAB-BOT to practice answering interview questions.
- Randomized responses: When BAB-BOT encounters an input it doesn't understand, it generates random responses to keep the conversation engaging.

## Usage
- Clone the repository or download the source code.
- Make sure you have Python installed (latest version).
- Prepare the necessary data files:
- Create a JSON file named responses.json containing the predefined responses and keywords for matching.
- Create a text file named initial.txt with the initial conversation prompt for BAB-BOT.
- Run the program by executing the following command: python main.py
- BAB-BOT will display the initial conversation prompt. Enter your responses or questions to interact with the chatbot.
- To quit the conversation, enter 0.

## Customization
- Modify the response.json file to add, remove, or modify the predefined responses and keywords for specific questions.
